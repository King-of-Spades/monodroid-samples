# Hello World (Publishing for Xamarin.Android)

This is a simple hello world type application to that goes along with
the Xamarin topic [Publishing an Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/publishing/).

This project contains a sample keystore called `xample.keystore`. This
keystore is only for demonstration purposes. Do not use it for anything
other than example purposes. The password is `password`, and the
keystore contains one key named `publishingdoc` with the password of
`password`.
