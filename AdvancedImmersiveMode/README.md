# Xamarin.Android Advanced Immersive Mode

Android 4.4 introduces a way for you to provide a more immersive
screen experience in your app, by letting users show or hide
the status bar and navigation bar with a swipe.

This sample demonstrates how this feature interacts with some
of the other UI flags related to full-screen apps. The sample
also shows how to implement a "sticky" mode, which re-hides
the bars a few seconds after the user swipes them back in.
