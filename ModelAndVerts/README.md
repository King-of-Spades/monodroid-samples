# MonoGame Project Combining Model and Vertex Drawing for Android

This project shows how to combine Model rendering with vertex array rendering in MonoGame.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library. It is the result of the [Working with Vertex Array in MonoGame](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/graphics-games/monogame/3d/part2) walkthrough.
