# MonoGame WalkingGame Project for Android

This is a small demo game using MonoGame for Android.  It is the result of working through the the entire [Introduction to Monogame walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/graphics-games/monogame/introduction/part2).

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library.

The demo can be played by touching the screen to move the character around the screen.
